# ImageProcessing
Tools and Algorithms for image processing

# Setup
Need Eigen, OpenCV (used to convert image to matrix), OpenGL (used for creating windows and display result of processed images) and CUDA (if Nvidia GPU available)

Eigen: Used for matrix operations
OpenCV: Image to matrix and vice versa conversion
OpenGL: Will be used for a simple GUI and displaying results
CUDA: Will be used to speed up the algorithms with multi-threading
